This is an example of coloring the wonum field and description field in Maximo's Work Order Tracking module.

You can color the text of a field by using a condition. When the condition is true, you can have the Property Values be active.

For example, a Property name of `cssclass` and value of `txtred` will color all text for that attribute red.

To activate, you need to go to Application Designer and right-click Properties on the attribute you want to edit.

Specify which Security Group you want this condition applied for.

Select the condition you want to take effect.

Specify what you want to be done when the condition is true or false.

Create the Property Values.

Note: There are other ways to accomplish the same result but this method allows without automation scripting.
